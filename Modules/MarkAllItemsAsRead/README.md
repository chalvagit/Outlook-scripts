# Mark All Items as Read
Use when you have a big structure of folders in your mailbox, but for some reason you don't need to read most of them.

## Data to be replaced
`<EMAIL>` - Name of your main folder (which usually is an email, but might be customised)
`<FOLDER>` - A folder name under the Inbox
> In line 13 you can remove or add more of `.folders.Item("<FOLDER>")` pieces as long as it satisfies your folder structure.
> You can also rename Inbox there if your Inbox folder has different name.
